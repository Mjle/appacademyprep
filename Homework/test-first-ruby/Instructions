If you need help running the tests, please read the README.md
To see test results, I use Terminal. 
We can use the following command line to see all test results:
#
# bundle exec rspec
#
OR to see single file specs
# Ex: for 12_rpn_calculator_spec.rb
# bundle exec rspec spec/12_rpn_calculator_spec.rb
#
