# App Academy Exercises

### Synopsis
This is Ruby prep-work for App Academy Coding Challenge. It consists of many problems you would get in an interview. It is all done in Ruby. I firstly code on the repl.it which they link us to.

### Setup

You can see some of their exercises on:

[Prep work for App Academy](http://prepwork.appacademy.io/coding-test-1/practice-problems/)
[repl.it link to code](https://repl.it/)

You can code stuff by their provided repl.it link which you can run Ruby and see their outputs.

It is optional to use Terminal (Mac OSX has pre-installed Ruby) to code.


### Notes
Solutions are made available for anyone practicing the code. It is of course suggested to do your own code.
My code were breezed through and may contain mistake. You can contact me @ le.michael6@gmail.com if you suggest/ comment on anything.

### Acknowledgements
Thanks App Academy for this coding opportunity.
